This is the first R Markdown for the midterm assignment.  It is provided as 3 different markdowns to insure that one question does not prevent anyone from completing other parts of the exam.  Please edit the markdown such by either (1) striking *italicized* words that are incorrect using ~~strikethrough~~ (\~\~strikethrough\~\~), (2) deleting the incorrect *italicized* terms, or (3) putting the correct answer where requested.

See below for an example.  We see that both _true_ and _false_ are options.  To answer the question, we delete _false_

## Example

**Before the exam**

* It is __true__ __false__ that the earth is round and the average temperature of the earth has risen within our lifetime

**After you edited by deleting __false__ or crossing it out, any one of these is ok **

* It is __true__ that the earth is round and the average temperature of the earth has risen within our lifetime
* It is __true__ ~~_false_~~ that the earth is round and the average temperature of the earth has risen within our lifetime

## Types of data (any language): 10 points

* "2" is a __Null__ __String__ __Integer__ __Float__  __Boolean__ datatype.
* 2 is a __Null__ __String__ __Integer__ __Float__ __Boolean__ datatype.
* 2.05 is an __Null__ __String__ __Integer__ __Float__  __Boolean__ datatype.
* 2.0 is an __Null__ __String__ __Integer__ __Float__  __Boolean__datatype.
* "" is an __Null__ __String__ __Integer__ __Float__  __Boolean__ datatype.
* "true" is an __Null__ __String__ __Integer__ __Fload__  __Boolean__ datatype.
* TRUE is an __Null__ __String__ __Integer__ __Fload__  __Boolean__ datatype.

## Types of data (R): 10 points

* When we run the command *a<-c("d",1,"b")* in *R*, creates a __dataframe__ __array__ __file__ __cat__ stored in *a*.

* After we create a variable *a* and fill it with data using the command a<-c("d",1,"b"), we can subset to *d<-a[2]*.  The type of data found in *d* is of type __string__ __integer__ __boolean__ __null__.

If you were to load in the diamonds dataset from the ggplot2 library, what type of data is found within diamonds$carat?

## Data (these are generalizable file formats, and not specific to R)

* csv files are typically __comma__ __space__ __colon__ deliminited

* The data below is typically __json__ __XML__ __tsv__?

> data ={
        name: "John",
        address: {
            street: "459 E Jon St.",
            city: "Springfield,
            state: "Illinois",
        },
        age:14
    }

* In the example above, data.age is  __Null__ __String__ __Integer__ __Boolean__ data-type

* In the example above, data.address is an __ordered__ or __unordered__ embedded document (or list)

## Licenses (10 Points)

* It is __True__ __False__, If I publish my code working at my new company as MIT License, I can utilize that code
at my next job as part of their projects provided I acknowledge the prior copyrights.

* It is __True__ __False__, I can include code R that is GNU GPLv3 within my code  provided I cite the prior copyrights.

* It is __True__ __False__, I didn't put a license file in my code but I posted it on github while working in a research laboratory. Because of my lack of thoroughness, I can never use that code again should I take another job, and if I do I could be held liable.
