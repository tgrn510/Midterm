This is the third R Markdown for the midterm assignment. In this example, you will create a Shiny App using diamonds that you will initate by diamonds<-diamonds.  It is worth 32 points if completed in full. The violin plot should let one choose their X-axis, Y-axis, Color-axis, Colorscale.

## Create this Violin Plot Designer

## Snapshot of your final version

This is just an image - don't let that confuse you.

That was just an image. If you are confused then just click on this link that comes next.

## Example Fully Working Version

  [What you will create - an example if you click me](http://itg.usc.edu:3838/tgrn510/violinator/)

## Please revise to diamonds

I have provided a script that gets you started and insures you don't get hung up on some details while still understanding concepts.  Please note that you need to use aes_string as I've done to convert the retuned variable to a string.

For the color schemes, the more the better - but you could choose different at http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html

The script below needs a lot of editing to get it to diamonds.  If you think it looks like a pain to edit, the first version of this exam I didn't include it.  Also, the coloring doesn't work - but all you have to do is go to one line on [this page](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-violin-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization) and just add it (6 points off if its published without the color working)
